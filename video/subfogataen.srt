13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,070
that the first thing you have to find is an

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,470
open space, a space where it can

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,059
be controlled, lighting a

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,530
fire, not the fire, you always have to

17
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,630
look for it to be  controlled that it is not a

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,490
huge bonfire, if it is going to be a

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,070
huge bonfire, look for a much more

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,110
open space. Here I am between several trees.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,479
The truth is that I do not see any risk. I

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,220
have the closest tree more than two meters

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,610
away from where the fire is going to be.  fire

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,160
and also clean the entire area the entire

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,650
area that also around the

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,259
stones I was already cleaning it I was

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,810
dragging it with my foot removing all the

28
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,570
possible tinder that could be ignited that

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,869
the match was the game in addition to

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,119
this I was previously hitting it with the with the

31
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,399
shovel climbing a small hole

32
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,110
to be able to reach the earth below

33
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,340
where the earth is all the

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,840
organic matter the truth is that it is very

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,580
complicated for it to catch fire it is very easy

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,470
for it to catch fire everything is on the

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,650
surface everything removes everything that

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,680
is around

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,830
So the truth is that it is the

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,940
safest way you can do it. The

41
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,000
other thing is also very important to

42
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,160
find stones. The stones are a

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,230
natural insulator for the town but they are not

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,520
going to learn, they are not going to heat up and they are not

45
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,490
going to pass the test.  sufficient amount of heat

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,350
to light something else that

47
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,050
you have the capacity to be able to isolate

48
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,480
where you are going to have the fire from the outside

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,860
is the best you can do then

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,630
the stones you can always find you can't

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,340
always find and you can see the

52
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,340
way to be able to get stones

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,020
first delete  Chunga Sacoyo

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,020


55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,980
and another thing that is very important,

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,659
normally when you are in the mountains

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,760
making a fire, it is to warm up so you

58
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:47,439
can cook, but if it is to warm

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,469
you, something very good that you can do is

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,480
make a heat reflector. When

61
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,639
you make a fire, the heat goes towards you.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,980
everywhere, if you

63
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,340
put a wall somewhere, that is what I have here,

64
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,079
and I will show you in a moment, what

65
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,299
you are going to achieve is being able to reflect the

66
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,879
heat where you want. I am
